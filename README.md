This is my first Swift/Apple iOS development project!

I am creating it as an unaffiliated (although would love to eventually collaborate with Evo to implement it officially) app which will work to do the following:

- Estimate Evo trip prices based on:
          -> Start/End Location
          -> Real time traffic data
          -> Number of additional stops
          -> Current Evo fare prices
          -> More to come!

As an Evo Carshare user myself I found myself checking maps to see how long a drive would take, having to mentally add on any extra stops, calculating that based on 
the per-minute/per-hour/per-day rates, and all in all I wondered, why hasn't Evo implemented something like this already? I took that as my idea and am going to run
with it.

Originally I was going to build a website for it since I'm more comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JS, but as a friend pointed out, Evo uses an app so making this an app
makes good sense. I have never used Swift before, but I look forward to the ups and downs that will come with this project.

My goal is to have pushed a workable and functioning version onto the app store by the end of 2024, and from there would love to continue updating it, building my skills,
and adding further features. 

If you read this you must be somewhat interested and I invite you to follow along on my journey of building an app from absolute scratch! 

Cheers,
Derek
