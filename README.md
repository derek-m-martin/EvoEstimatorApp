### **About the Project**

Welcome to the **EvoEstimator** app! This is my first attempt at **Swift/Apple iOS development**, and I’m excited to share my journey with you.

#### _What is EvoEstimator?_
The **EvoEstimator** app aims to provide an estimate of Evo Carshare trip prices based on:
- **Start/End Location**
- **Real-time traffic data**
- **Number of additional stops**
- **Current Evo fare prices**
- _More features coming soon!_

As an Evo Carshare user, I often found myself:
- Checking maps to see how long a drive would take
- Mentally adding up any extra stops
- Calculating the fare based on per-minute, per-hour, or per-day rates

I thought, _"Why hasn't Evo implemented something like this already?"_ And that’s where **EvoEstimator** comes in.

### **Why an iOS App?**

Originally, I was going to build a website for **EvoEstimator** since I’m more comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JS. But as a friend pointed out, Evo uses an app, so building an iOS app made perfect sense.

### **Project Goals**

My goal is to have a functioning and workable version on the App Store by **the end of 2024**. After that, I plan to continue updating and improving the app, expanding its features, and growing my development skills.

### **Follow My Journey**

If you’ve read this far, thank you! You must be at least somewhat interested, and I invite you to follow along on my journey of building this app from scratch.

Cheers,  
**Derek**
